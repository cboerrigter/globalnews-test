boerrigter001,VoiceofAmerica.JPG,3037,Voice of America (VOA) News,image/jpeg,"""Voice of America (VOA) is a United States government-funded multimedia news source and the official external broadcasting institution of the United States. VOA provides programming for broadcast on radio, television, and the Internet outside of the U.S., in English and some foreign languages. The VOA charterâ€”signed into law in 1976 by President Gerald Fordâ€”requires VOA to 'serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news' and 'be accurate, objective and comprehensive.' The Voice of America headquarters is located at 330 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, D.C., 20237. The VOA is fully funded by the U.S. government; the Congress appropriates funds for it annually under the same budget for embassies and consulates. VOA radio and television broadcasts are distributed by satellite, cable and on FM, AM, and shortwave radio frequencies. They are streamed on individual language service websites, social media sites and mobile platforms. VOA has affiliate and contract agreements with radio and television stations and cable networks worldwide. Some scholars and commentators consider Voice of America to be a form of propaganda, although this label is disputed by others."" -- Summary retrieved on October 7, 2019 http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voice_of_America",English,Government,European Studies; Journalism; National Security,https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0003037/,
